# UnConference Pre-Event Logistic

**Open Source Materials Developed for the Music City Legal Hackathon & UnConference**

The following outline is for April 8th, 2017

## Materials at: [UnConf.org](http://UnConf.org)

If there are issues with the domain name, the site at UnConf.org is also available at the native GitHub Pages URL: https://computationallaw.github.io/UnConference  

**UPDATE:** Let’s use the GitHub accessible site above (at UnConf.org) for ease of rapid updates and adding more cooks to the kitchen.  For long term access purposes, the Computational Law research program at MIT will also back materials up for you at a mirror version here: http://MIT.edu/Law/MusicCityLegalHackathon  

## Contents in Progress 

The following materials for Music City Legal Hackathon UnConference are under development and will be linked as they become available for review/feedback and use:


* I’ll create a directory and upload basic materials for your team and event participants on "how to self-organize an unconference" to unconf.org .  

* Look for a short description of the basic process, 
* a simple checklist for people who have ideas and want to lead a discussing on "proposing, pitching and running a session" 
* a corresponding simple checklist for participants on "choosing and participating in sessions"  
* some "template" materials
* I'll also make a brief and simple little video for you to play for unconference-goers that talks through the basic concept of how Unconfernces are different, what to expect and how to 1) lead, 2) participate in, 3) take notes for and 3) report out about a session. 

##  Session Timing: 

I'd suggest keeping it really simple to with just two "main sessions" tomorrow, a morning and afternoon round from, 10:00-11:00 and 1:30-2:30 and make it easy for " it's of a feather" sessions to develop before as after each main round. You could try two rounds in the afternoon from 1:30-2:30 and 2:45-3:45 if ambitious. I'll send the Google Slide template with timing for two rounds and easy self-forming birds of a feather seasons but you can update it or ask me to update it for more of different timing or structure.  

I'll include slides and timing in the deck for the initial talk through in a circle and session "pitches" and also time for report out from each session back to the circle during lunch and before hackathon project presentations.  

UPDATE: Cat is the point of contact and facilitator on site.

## Physical Space 

Last thing is physical space layout. You'll need a wall for posting stuff and enough chairs and big enough space to circle the chairs near the posting wall.  Also need several tables or small rooms for sessions.
